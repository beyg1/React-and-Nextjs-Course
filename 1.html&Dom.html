<!--Declarative Programming vs Imperative Programming
Declarative programming focuses on what to do, while imperative programming focuses on how to do it
In the above code, we are using Imperative programming to create and manipulate the DOM
We are explicitly told the browser how to create h1 tag, set their content, and append them to the DOM
The script tag in this HTML file is imperative because it tells the browser step-by-step how to 
create and manipulate the h1 tag and it's content through DOM methods.
In declarative programming, you would describe the desired state of the UI, and the framework would handle the updates
For example, in simple HTML, you might just write <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1> even if it is initial
page content and not updated content throuh Dom. it's just a simple example i am giving. -->
